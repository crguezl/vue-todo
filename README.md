## Observations

When I tried wit the `file:// ` protocol and also `http://0.0.0.0:8080/index.html` it worked but the link between data and view failed when using the `localhost:8080` address, also when using `http://10.209.2.191:8080/` it worked with the form but not with `0.0.0.0`. 
I don't know what is going on.
